Third Generation(A70; 1986)
<p></p></u></h1>
In February 1986, the bonds between the Celica and the Supra were cut; they were now
two completely different models. The Celica changed to a front-wheel drive layout,
using the Toyota "T" platform associated with the Corona, while the Supra kept its
rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine was updated to a more powerful 2,954 cc (3.0 L)
inline-six engine rated at 149 kW (200 hp; 203 PS). Although initially only available
with naturally aspirated engines, a turbocharged version was added in the 1987 model
year. The Supra was now mechanically related to the Soarer.All Japanese market models
with the various versions of the2.0 L engine were slightly narrower overall so as to 
be in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations so that Japanese buyers
weren't liable for yearly taxes for driving a larger car.
