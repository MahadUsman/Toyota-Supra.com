Fourth Generation(A80; 1993)
<p></p></u></h1>
The A80 program began in February 1989 under various teams for design,
product planning, and engineering led by Isao Tsuzuki. By the middle
of 1990, a final A80 design concept from Toyota Technical Centre Aichi
was approved and frozen for production in late 1990. The first test 
mules were hand-built in A70 bodies during late 1990, followed by the
first A80 prototypes being hand-assembled in 1991. Again using subframe,
suspension, and drivetrain assemblies from the Z30 Soarer (Lexus SC300/400),
pre-production of the test models started in December 1992 with 20 units 
made, and official mass production began in April 1993.
