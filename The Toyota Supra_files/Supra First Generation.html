Supra First Generation

First Generation(A40/A50;1978)
<p></p></u></h1>
The first generation of the Supra was based largely upon the Toyota Celica liftback, but was longer by 129.5 mm (5.10 in).
The doors and rear section were shared with the Celica but the front panels were elongated to accommodate the Inline-6 
instead of the Celica's 4-cylinder engine. Toyota's original plan for the Supra at this time was to make it a competitor
to the very popular Datsun (now Nissan).
