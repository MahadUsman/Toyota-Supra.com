Second Generation(A60; 1981)
<p></p></u></h1>
In mid 1981, Toyota completely redesigned the Celica Supra as well as the
entire Celica lineup for the 1982 model year. In Japan, they were known as
the Celica XX, but the Celica Supra name was used for the world market.
Still based on the Celica platform, there were several key differences,
most notably the design of the front end and fully retractable pop-up
headlights. Other differences were the inline-six rather than four-cylinder
engine, as well as an increase in length and wheelbase to accommodate the 
larger engine. Cars installed with the 5M engine were slightly wider, 
while other models remained compliant with Japanese dimension regulations.
