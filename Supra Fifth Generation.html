Fifth Generation(J29/DB; 2019)
<p></p></u></h1>
The fifth-generation Supra was released in January 2019 as the GR Supra, 
part of Toyota's Gazoo Racing (GR) family of performance cars. It was 
developed in partnership with BMW, sharing the platform and many parts 
from the BMW Z4 (G29) with BMW derived 4- and 6-cylinder turbocharged 
engines and maintaining rear-wheel drive layout from the previous Supra. 
The model is designated with BMW model codes "J29" or "DB", however Toyota
used the "A90" and "A91" codes for promotional and marketing materials for
the fifth-generation Supra to maintain the lineage from the previous Supra.
The GR Supra is manufactured at the Magna Steyr plant in Graz, Austria 
alongside the Z4.
